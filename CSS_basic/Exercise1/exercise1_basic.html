            <p>The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.
               It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.
               A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact.
               Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to hunt rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries

                <p>Cats were first domesticated in the Near East around 7500 BC.[11] It was long thought that cat domestication was initiated in ancient Egypt,
                   as since around 3100 BC veneration was given to cats in ancient Egypt. As of 2021 there are an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the world. 
                   As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second-most popular pet in the United States, with 95 million cats owned.
                   In the United Kingdom, around 7.3 million cats lived in more than 4.8 million households as of 2019.
